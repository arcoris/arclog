package caller

import "arcoris.dev/arclog/api/buffer"

// Encoder appends caller information to dst and returns the buffer that should
// be used for subsequent writes.
//
// An Encoder receives a destination buffer dst and a Caller value, then appends
// an encoded representation of that caller. Implementations SHOULD write into
// the existing buffer when possible, but MAY obtain and return a different
// *buffer.Buffer if their own buffering policy requires it.
//
// The pointer returned from Encoder MUST be treated as the authoritative
// destination after the call. Callers MUST:
//
//   - use the returned *buffer.Buffer for any subsequent writes related to
//     this encoding step, and
//   - eventually release that buffer according to the Buffer contract
//     (typically via Free).
//
// Implementations MUST NOT call Free on either the incoming dst or the
// returned buffer; lifetime management is always the caller's responsibility.
// If a different buffer pointer is returned than the one passed in, the
// original dst MUST remain in a valid state according to its own contract,
// and the Encoder MUST NOT retain references to either buffer beyond the
// duration of the call.
//
// When Caller.Defined is false, implementations MAY choose to append nothing,
// append a placeholder, or encode an explicit "unknown" representation. This
// behavior SHOULD be documented by the concrete Encoder, and callers MUST NOT
// make assumptions about the exact textual format beyond what the
// implementation explicitly guarantees.
