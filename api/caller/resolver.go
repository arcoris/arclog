package caller

// Resolver captures call-site information from the current goroutine stack.
//
// The primary purpose of a Resolver is to decouple call-site inspection from
// the rest of the logging pipeline. Runtime packages can provide stack-walking
// implementations, tests can provide deterministic fakes, and platform-specific
// code can choose its own symbolization strategy.
//
// Unless explicitly documented otherwise, implementations SHOULD be safe for
// concurrent use by multiple goroutines, since loggers typically resolve call
// sites from many call points in parallel.
type Resolver interface {
	// Caller returns information about the call site located skip stack frames
	// above the point where this method is invoked.
	//
	// The skip parameter follows the conventional runtime.Caller contract:
	//
	//   - skip == 0 refers to the frame of Resolver.Caller itself;
	//   - skip == 1 refers to the immediate caller of Resolver.Caller;
	//   - higher values walk further up the call stack.
	//
	// Implementations SHOULD document any deviations from this convention, such
	// as internally adjusting skip to hide wrapper frames. If the requested
	// frame cannot be resolved, the returned Caller value MUST have Defined set
	// to false, and all other fields SHOULD be treated as unspecified.
