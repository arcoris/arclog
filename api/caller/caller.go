package caller

// Caller represents source-code location metadata associated with a log entry.
// It captures enough information to identify the originating call site at the
// time the entry was created.
//
// A Caller value MAY be attached to a log entry to improve debuggability, stack
// trace correlation, or integration with external tooling. When Caller.Defined
// is false, all other fields MUST be treated as unspecified and MUST NOT be
// relied upon.
//
// The zero value is an undefined caller. It is safe to store and pass around,
// and encoders should treat it the same way they treat any Caller with Defined
// set to false.
type Caller struct {
	// Defined reports whether this Caller contains usable location information.
	//
	// When Defined is false, the remaining fields (PC, File, Line, Function)
	// MUST be considered undefined and MUST NOT be used for display, routing,
	// or analysis. Callers MAY still carry a zero-valued Caller in this case
	// to explicitly indicate that call-site capture was disabled or unavailable.
	//
	// When Defined is true, the implementation SHOULD ensure that PC, File,
	// and Line are populated consistently, and Function SHOULD be populated
	// when that information is available.
	Defined bool

	// PC is the program counter associated with the call site.
	//
	// When Defined is true, PC SHOULD correspond to an address that can be
	// resolved by runtime or symbolization tools into a concrete function and
	// source location. When Defined is false, PC MAY be zero and MUST NOT be
	// inspected or symbolized by consumers.
	//
	// Implementations MAY choose to omit PC (for example, by leaving it at 0)
	// in environments where capturing it is too expensive or not supported.
	PC uintptr

	// File is the source file path associated with the call site.
	//
	// When Defined is true and File is non-empty, it SHOULD identify the file
	// that contains the call that produced the log entry. The exact format
	// (absolute vs relative, trimmed prefixes, path separator style) is
	// implementation-defined and SHOULD be documented by the runtime package.
	//
	// When Defined is false, File SHOULD be the empty string and MUST NOT be
	// relied upon by consumers.
	File string

	// Line is the 1-based source line within File.
	//
	// When Defined is true and Line > 0, it SHOULD indicate the source line
	// associated with the call. A value of 0 or a negative value MUST be
	// treated as "unknown line" even if Defined is true.
	//
	// When Defined is false, Line SHOULD be 0 and MUST NOT be interpreted as
	// a valid source line.
	Line int

	// Function is a best-effort name of the function that contains the call
	// site.
	//
	// When Defined is true, Function MAY contain a fully-qualified name
	// (including package and receiver) or another implementation-defined
	// representation. Consumers MUST NOT rely on a particular naming format
	// beyond what is explicitly documented by the implementation.
	//
	// When Defined is false, Function SHOULD be the empty string and MUST be
	// treated as unspecified. Even when Defined is true, Function MAY be empty
	// if name resolution is not available in the current environment.
	Function string
